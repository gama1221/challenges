## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Docker Compose configuration for the application, the CI/CD pipeline setup using Azure DevOps, and the implementation of a logging stack utilizing Fluentd and OpenSearch. Additionally, it outlines strategies for optimizing Docker images and ensuring adherence to security best practices.

## CI/CD with Azure DevOps

### Pipeline Creation

1. **Pipeline Configuration**: Create a pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate the deployment of the application. This pipeline will encompass stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.

2. **Docker Swarm for Orchestration**: 
   - Implement Docker Swarm to facilitate the management and orchestration of services, allowing for seamless scaling and deployment across multiple nodes.
   - Define the service stack using a `docker-compose.yml` file that incorporates all necessary services, including `todo-api`, `todo-front`, `cassandra`, `fluentd`, `opensearch`, and `opensearch-dashboard`.

3. **Optimized Docker Images**: 
   - Utilize multi-stage builds in Dockerfiles to minimize the size of the final images, improving deployment speed and reducing resource consumption.
   - Implement caching strategies and eliminate unnecessary layers to further enhance image performance.

4. **Branch Policies**: 
   - Configure branch policies to enforce quality checks prior to deployments, including mandatory pull request reviews and automated testing.
   - Establish distinct environments for testing and production to validate code thoroughly before it is merged into the main branches.

### Pipeline Configuration

The Azure DevOps pipeline is defined to build and deploy the Next.js frontend service. Below is the YAML configuration for the pipeline:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
      - develop

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

jobs:
- job: BuildNextJsService
  displayName: 'Build Next.js Frontend'
  steps:
  - script: |
      cd todo-front
      npm install
      npm run build
    displayName: 'Build Next.js Frontend'

  - script: |
      docker build -t your-docker-repo/todo-front:$(Build.BuildId) .
    displayName: 'Build Docker Image'

  - task: Docker@2
    inputs:
      containerRegistry: 'your-service-connection' # Define your service connection
      repository: 'your-docker-repo/todo-front'
      command: 'push'
      tags: '$(Build.BuildId)'

  - stage: Deploy
    displayName: 'Deploy to Environment'
    jobs:
    - deployment: DeployNextJsService
      displayName: 'Deploy Next.js Frontend'
      environment: 'test' # Change to your environment
      strategy:
        runOnce:
          deploy:
            steps:
            - script: echo "Deploying Next.js to test environment"
              displayName: 'Deploy Next.js'
```

2. **Docker Swarm for Orchestration**: 
   - Implement Docker Swarm to facilitate the management and orchestration of services, allowing for seamless scaling and deployment across multiple nodes.

   - Establish distinct environments for testing and production to validate code thoroughly before it is merged into the main branches.

## Logging Stack Setup with Fluentd and OpenSearch

1. **Fluentd Configuration**: 
   - Set up Fluentd to collect application logs and route them to OpenSearch for centralized logging and monitoring.
   - Define input and output configurations to handle various log formats effectively.

2. **OpenSearch Setup**: 
   - Deploy OpenSearch for log storage and indexing, ensuring proper configuration for high availability and optimal performance.
   - Leverage security features, such as role-based access control and SSL/TLS encryption, to safeguard log data.

## Security Best Practices

- **Image Security**: Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities and utilize official base images.
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information in Azure DevOps secure variables to avoid hardcoding credentials in Dockerfiles or application code.
- **Network Security**: Utilize Dockerâ€™s network segmentation features to isolate services and restrict container communication.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Establish monitoring for the CI/CD pipeline and logging stack to promptly detect and address issues.

## Bonus: Documentation and Ansible Integration

### Documentation

Robust documentation is essential for application maintenance and team onboarding. Key components include:

- **Architecture Overview**: A detailed description of the application architecture and service interactions.
- **Deployment Process**: Step-by-step instructions for deploying the application via Azure DevOps.
- **Logging Configuration**: Documentation of the Fluentd and OpenSearch setup, including configuration for inputs and outputs.

### Ansible for Fluentd and OpenSearch Setup

To automate Fluentd and OpenSearch deployments, Ansible can be utilized:

1. **Playbook Creation**: Develop Ansible playbooks that define installation and configuration procedures for Fluentd and OpenSearch on target servers.
2. **Role-Based Configuration**: Organize tasks into reusable roles for better maintainability.
3. **Inventory Management**: Maintain an inventory file to specify target servers, enabling efficient scaling and management of the logging stack.

## Docker Image Optimization

To enhance the efficiency and performance of the Docker images used in this application, the following strategies were implemented:

1. **Multi-Stage Builds**: 
   - The Dockerfile employs multi-stage builds to separate the build environment from the production environment, reducing the final image size and including only the necessary artifacts for application execution.

2. **Base Image Selection**: 
   - Utilizing the `node:18-alpine` base image minimizes the overall size compared to standard Debian-based images.

3. **Conditional Dependency Installation**: 
   - Dependencies are installed based on the presence of specific lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`), ensuring consistent installations and flexibility in managing dependencies.

4. **User Permissions**: 
   - The application runs as a non-root user (`nextjs`) to enhance security and prevent privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

5. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Environment variables are used to configure application settings, making the images more flexible and easier to maintain without code changes.
